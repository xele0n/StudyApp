# How to Run the Study App

## Prerequisites
- Mac computer with macOS Monterey or later
- Xcode 13 or later (Xcode 14+ recommended)
- An Apple Developer account (for testing on a physical device)
- iOS 15.0+ device or simulator (iOS 16+ recommended for full FamilyControls functionality)

## Setting Up the Project

1. **Open the project in Xcode**
   - Launch Xcode
   - Select "Open a project or file"
   - Navigate to the StudyApp folder and open it
   - If prompted, select "Trust and Open"

2. **Configure Signing & Capabilities**
   - Select the StudyApp project in the Navigator
   - Select the "StudyApp" target
   - Go to the "Signing & Capabilities" tab
   - Sign in with your Apple Developer account
   - Choose a Team
   - Add the "Family Controls" capability if not already present

3. **Request the Family Controls Entitlement**
   - The Family Controls framework requires special entitlement from Apple
   - For full functionality, you need to request this entitlement:
     - Visit https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/family-controls-entitlement/
     - Fill out the form explaining your app's usage of Screen Time API
     - Wait for Apple's approval (may take several days)
   - For now, the app will build but the app blocking features may not fully function

## Running the App

### On a Simulator
1. Select an iOS simulator from the device menu in Xcode (next to the Run/Stop buttons)
2. Click the Run button (▶️) or press Cmd+R
3. The app will build and launch in the simulator
4. Note: Some Screen Time API features may not fully function in a simulator

### On a Physical Device
1. Connect your iOS device to your Mac with a USB cable
2. Select your device from the device menu in Xcode
3. Click the Run button (▶️) or press Cmd+R
4. You may need to trust your development certificate on your device
5. The app will install and launch on your device

## Troubleshooting

### Build Errors
- **Family Controls Framework Not Found**: Make sure you're targeting iOS 15.0 or later
- **Signing Issues**: Verify your Apple Developer account and team are properly set up
- **Entitlement Issues**: You can still build and run without the Family Controls entitlement, but app blocking will be limited

### Runtime Issues
- **Authorization Failed**: The user must grant permission for your app to use Screen Time API
- **App Selection Not Working**: Ensure you're testing on a real device with iOS 15+
- **Missing Entitlement**: The full functionality requires Apple's approval for the entitlement

## Testing App Blocking

1. Launch the app
2. Go to the "Revision" tab
3. Tap "Select Apps to Block" button
4. Choose apps to block in the system UI that appears
5. Toggle "Block Distracting Apps" to ON
6. Choose a duration (1, 2, or 3 hours)
7. The selected apps will now be blocked (if proper entitlement is granted)

## Note on Screen Time API Limitations

Until you receive the official Family Controls entitlement from Apple, you may experience the following limitations:

- The app selection UI may appear but selections might not be saved
- App blocking may not be enforced by the system
- You might see authorization errors in the console

The app has been designed to degrade gracefully if the entitlements aren't available, so you can still test all other functionality.
